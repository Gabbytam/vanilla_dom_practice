        <h3 id="pop">Why you should visit</h3>
        <p>Carlsbad is a great place for a quite and calm visit to California! You'll find secluded beaches, grand sand cliff sides, and a welcoming downtown area for drinking and dining. Adults can enjoy a relaxing day at La Costa Resort where they can hit the spa, the pool, and/or the golf course. If you're looking for something fun for the kids, take them down to Legoland Califoria for rides, aquarium, water park, and more! San Diego is not a far drive; Mexico isn't too far either! For those willing, seek out the rope swing off the hillside overlooking bataquitos lagoon.</p>
